/**
 * A mid-level obstacle that slows the player more than a balloon.
 *
 * Kites apply a stronger penalty to downward momentum, increasing
 * the risk of falling below minimum speed. Not lethal, but dangerous
 * in combination with other obstacles.
 *
 * Often used to create vertical tension or delay progress.
