/**
 * Controls global game speed and pacing rules.
 *
 * Handles the dynamic acceleration of game elements over time,
 * ensuring gameplay becomes more intense without breaking the frame rate.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Track current speed, min/max velocity bounds.
 * - Apply speed increases over time.
 * - Handle speed penalties (e.g., hitting obstacles).
 *
 * Should be called once per frame to adjust simulation pacing.
